ldesc: "Eterm is a color vt102 terminal emulator intended as a 
replacement for xterm. It is designed with a Freedom of Choice 
philosophy, leaving as much power, flexibility, and freedom as possible 
in the hands of the user. It is designed to look good and work well, but 
takes a feature-rich approach rather than one of minimalism while still 
maintaining speed and efficiency."
